# fetchPractice1

Practice It - Fetch
~~Create a new repo in your GitHub called FetchPractice-1~~

~~Clone it into your devFolder~~

~~Inside the new repo create two files: index.html and main.js~~

~~Copy/paste the code below into the respective files~~

While working throughout this fetch practice make sure you reference and read in its entirety the MDN Docs on fetch()

Using the documents at jsonplaceholder, for each of the buttons listed in the index.html file:

Create a function that fetches the data the button should fetch

Push the response into an array: arrayOfPosts

Display them as an li in a ul

Using the docs on jsonplaceholder, post a new post to the database.

Using the docs, put (edit) a post.

Get this all finished before coming into class.

If you don't you will be very unprepared
